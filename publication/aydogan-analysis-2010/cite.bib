 abstract = {In this paper we are analyzing multiple μ-CT image sets to estimate pore-size distribution based on minimum visible pore-size at a given resolution. As similar approaches rely strongly on segmentation results, we are evaluating and comparing 5 different thresholding based segmentation approaches. The application of the method is demonstrated on Al2O3 bulk imaged at 7 different resolutions.},
