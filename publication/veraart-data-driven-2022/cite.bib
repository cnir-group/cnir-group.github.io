 abstract = {The preprocessing of dMRI data sets is a critical step in the experimental workflow that, in general, improves the data reliability. We provide a comprehensive survey of the preprocessing workflows for dMRI data within our research community, assessing their variability and quantifying its impact on the dMRI metric reproducibility and inter-site comparisons. We observed that the lack of a standardized preprocessing pipeline across researchers is a significant source of variability that might lower the reproducibility of studies. These preliminary results highlight the need for harmonization of the image preprocessing workflow for dMRI data to promote more robust and reproducible analyses.},
