 abstract = {Topographical organization is an integral property of brainâ€™s neural pathways. In this work we propose a novel approach to quantify the topographic preservation of fiber bundles obtained using dMRI based tractography. For that we used the well known organization of the somatosensory pathway. In our study we compared the tractograms obtained using our recently developed tractography algorithm with MRtrix's iFOD1 and iFOD2 probabilistic techniques. We believe topographical organization is critical to take into consideration for tractography research for both validation purposes as well as for developing better performing tractography algorithms.},
