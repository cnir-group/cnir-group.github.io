 abstract = {We present results from round 2 of IronTract, the first challenge to evaluate the accuracy of tractography using i) tracer injections and diffusion MRI from the same macaque brains, and ii) DSI and HCP two-shell diffusion acquisition schemes. In round 1, only two teams achieved similarly high performance between the two different injection sites that we used for training and validation. Here we investigate the extent to which this was due to the pre- and post-processing used by those teams. We show that, when other teams use the same pre- and post-processing, their accuracy and robustness can improve as well.},
