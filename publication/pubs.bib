	abstract = {Background
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is an established treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). Recent attempts to improve TMS efficacy by individually targeting DLPFC subregions that are functionally connected to the subgenual cingulate cortex (sgACC) appear promising. However, sgACC covers only a small subset of core MDD-related areas. Further, fMRI connectivity of sgACC is poorly repeatable within subjects.
Methods
Based on an fMRI database analysis, we first constructed a novel core network model (CNM), capturing voxelwise emotion regulation- and MDD-related DLPFC connectivity. Then, in a sample of 15 healthy subjects and 29 MDD patients, we assessed (i) within-subject repeatability of the DLPFC connectivity patterns computed from time segments of varying lengths of individual-level fMRI data and (ii) association of MDD severity with the individual DLPFC connectivity strengths. We extracted group-level connectivity strengths in CNM from individual DLPFC coordinates stimulated with neuronavigated TMS in a separate sample of 25 MDD patients. These connectivity strengths were then correlated with individual TMS efficacy.
Results
Compared with sgACC connectivity, CNM increased intraindividual repeatability 5-fold. DLPFC connectivity strength from CNM was associated with MDD severity and TMS efficacy. While the locations of CNM-based individual TMS targets remained constant within individuals, they varied considerably between individuals.
Conclusions
CNM increased repeatability of functional targeting to a clinically feasible level. The observed association of MDD severity and TMS efficacy with DLPFC connectivity supports the validity of the CNM. The interindividual differences in target locations motivate future individualized clinical trials leveraging the CNM.},

	abstract = {Background State-of-the-art navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) systems can display the TMS coil position relative to the structural magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the subject’s brain and calculate the induced electric field. However, the local effect of TMS propagates via the white-matter network to different areas of the brain, and currently there is no commercial or research neuronavigation system that can highlight in real time the brain’s structural connections during TMS.
Objective To develop a real-time tractography-assisted TMS neuronavigation system and investigate its feasibility.
Method We propose a modular framework that seamlessly integrates offline (preparatory) analysis of diffusion MRI data with online (real-time) tractography. For tractography and neuronavigation we combine our custom software Trekker and InVesalius, respectively. We evaluate the feasibility of our system by comparing online and offline tractography results in terms of streamline count and their overlap.
Results A real-time tractography-assisted TMS neuronavigation system is developed. Key features include the application of state-of-the-art tractography practices, the ability to tune tractography parameters on the fly, and the display of thousands of new streamlines every few seconds using a novel uncertainty visualization technique. We demonstrate in a video the feasibility and quantitatively show the agreement with offline filtered streamlines.
Conclusion Real-time tractography-assisted TMS neuronavigation is feasible. With our system, it is possible to target specific brain regions based on their structural connectivity, and to aim for the fiber tracts that make up the brain’s networks.},

	abstract = {Limitations in the accuracy of brain pathways reconstructed by diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography have received considerable attention. While the technical advances spearheaded by the Human Connectome Project (HCP) led to significant improvements in dMRI data quality, it remains unclear how these data should be analyzed to maximize tractography accuracy. Over a period of two years, we have engaged the dMRI community in the IronTract Challenge, which aims to answer this question by leveraging a unique dataset. Macaque brains that have received both tracer injections and ex vivo dMRI at high spatial and angular resolution allow a comprehensive, quantitative assessment of tractography accuracy on state-of-the-art dMRI acquisition schemes. We find that, when analysis methods are carefully optimized, the HCP scheme can achieve similar accuracy as a more time-consuming, Cartesian-grid scheme. Importantly, we show that simple pre- and post-processing strategies can improve the accuracy and robustness of many tractography methods. Finally, we find that fiber configurations that go beyond crossing (e.g., fanning, branching) are the most challenging for tractography. The IronTract Challenge remains open and we hope that it can serve as a valuable validation tool for both users and developers of dMRI analysis methods.},

An emerging method is to use functional brain imaging to select the cortical seed points for tractography, which is considered to improve the functional relevance and validity of the studied connections. However, it is unknown whether different functional seeding methods affect the spatial and microstructural properties of the given white matter connection. Here, we compared functional magnetic resonance imaging, magnetoencephalography, and manual seeding of thalamocortical proprioceptive tracts for finger and ankle joints separately. We showed that all three seeding approaches resulted in robust thalamocortical tracts, even though there were significant differences in localization of the respective proprioceptive seed areas in the sensorimotor cortex, and in the microstructural properties of the obtained tracts. Our study shows that the selected functional or manual seeding approach might cause systematic biases to the studied thalamocortical tracts. This result may indicate that the obtained tracts represent different portions and features of the somatosensory system. Our findings highlight the challenges of studying proprioception in the developing brain and illustrate the need for using multimodal imaging to obtain a comprehensive view of the studied brain process.},

These diffusion models reveal detailed insights into white matter microstructural changes with development, pathology and function. Here, we aim at assessing the clinical utility of diffusion MRI metrics along the corticospinal tract, investigating whether motor glioma patients can be classified with respect to their motor status. We retrospectively included 116 brain tumour patients suffering from either left or right supratentorial, unilateral World Health Organization Grades II, III and IV gliomas with a mean age of 53.51 ± 16.32 years. Around 37\% of patients presented with preoperative motor function deficits according to the Medical Research Council scale. At group level comparison, the highest non-overlapping diffusion MRI differences were detected in the superior portion of the tracts’ profiles. Fractional anisotropy and fibre density decrease, apparent diffusion coefficient axial diffusivity and radial diffusivity increase. To predict motor deficits, we developed a method based on a support vector machine using histogram-based features of diffusion MRI tract profiles (e.g. mean, standard deviation, kurtosis and skewness), following a recursive feature elimination method. Our model achieved high performance (74\% sensitivity, 75\% specificity, 74\% overall accuracy and 77\% area under the curve). We found that apparent diffusion coefficient, fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity contributed more than other features to the model. Incorporating the patient demographics and clinical features such as age, tumour World Health Organization grade, tumour location, gender and resting motor threshold did not affect the model’s performance, revealing that these features were not as effective as microstructural measures. These results shed light on the potential patterns of tumour-related microstructural white matter changes in the prediction of functional deficits.},

	abstract = {Tractography is a powerful tool to study structural connectivity of the brain. However, its accuracy is known to be limited and tractograms are contaminated with large numbers of false positive streamlines. In this work, we propose a novel tractogram filtering approach. Our method leverages the topographic regularity of connections with which nearby streamline tend to follow similar trajectories. With this observation, we introduce an anisotropic smoothing approach for track orientation density images. These images are back projected onto the streamlines, which provides information about fiber-to-bundle coupling (FICO). Streamlines are then filtered by thresholding their FICO value.},

	abstract = {The number of international benchmarking competitions is steadily increasing in various fields of machine learning (ML) research and practice. So far, however, little is known about the common practice as well as bottlenecks faced by the community in tackling the research questions posed. To shed light on the status quo of algorithm development in the specific field of biomedical imaging analysis, we designed an international survey that was issued to all participants of challenges conducted in conjunction with the IEEE ISBI 2021 and MICCAI 2021 conferences (80 competitions in total). The survey covered participants' expertise and working environments, their chosen strategies, as well as algorithm characteristics. A median of 72\% challenge participants took part in the survey. According to our results, knowledge exchange was the primary incentive (70\%) for participation, while the reception of prize money played only a minor role (16\%). While a median of 80 working hours was spent on method development, a large portion of participants stated that they did not have enough time for method development (32\%). 25\% perceived the infrastructure to be a bottleneck. Overall, 94\% of all solutions were deep learning-based. Of these, 84\% were based on standard architectures. 43\% of the respondents reported that the data samples (e.g., images) were too large to be processed at once. This was most commonly addressed by patch-based training (69\%), downsampling (37\%), and solving 3D analysis tasks as a series of 2D tasks. K-fold cross-validation on the training set was performed by only 37\% of the participants and only 50\% of the participants performed ensembling based on multiple identical models (61\%) or heterogeneous models (39\%). 48\% of the respondents applied postprocessing steps.},

	abstract = {White matter bundle segmentation using diffusion MRI fiber tractography has become the method of choice to identify white matter fiber pathways in vivo in human brains. However, like other analyses of complex data, there is considerable variability in segmentation protocols and techniques. This can result in different reconstructions of the same intended white matter pathways, which directly affects tractography results, quantification, and interpretation. In this study, we aim to evaluate and quantify the variability that arises from different protocols for bundle segmentation. Through an open call to users of fiber tractography, including anatomists, clinicians, and algorithm developers, 42 independent teams were given processed sets of human whole-brain streamlines and asked to segment 14 white matter fascicles on six subjects. In total, we received 57 different bundle segmentation protocols, which enabled detailed volume-based and streamline-based analyses of agreement and disagreement among protocols for each fiber pathway. Results show that even when given the exact same sets of underlying streamlines, the variability across protocols for bundle segmentation is greater than all other sources of variability in the virtual dissection process, including variability within protocols and variability across subjects. In order to foster the use of tractography bundle dissection in routine clinical settings, and as a fundamental analytical tool, future endeavors must aim to resolve and reduce this heterogeneity. Although external validation is needed to verify the anatomical accuracy of bundle dissections, reducing heterogeneity is a step towards reproducible research and may be achieved through the use of standard nomenclature and definitions of white matter bundles and well-chosen constraints and decisions in the dissection process.},

The delineation of the healthy-pathological white matter (WM) interface area, for which diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) has shown promising potential, may improve treatment outcome. However, up to 90\% of white matter (WM) voxels include multiple fiber populations, which cannot be correctly described with traditional metrics such as fractional anisotropy (FA) or apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Here, we used a novel fixel-based along-tract analysis consisting of constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD)-based probabilistic tractography and fixel-based apparent fiber density (FD), capable of identifying fiber orientation specific microstructural metrics. We addressed this novel methodology’s capability to detect corticospinal tract impairment. We measured and compared tractogram-related FD and traditional microstructural metrics bihemispherically in 65 patients with WHO grade III and IV gliomas infiltrating the motor system. The cortical tractogram seeds were based on motor maps derived by transcranial magnetic stimulation. We extracted 100 equally distributed cross-sections along each streamline of corticospinal tract (CST) for along-tract statistical analysis. Cross-sections were then analyzed to detect differences between healthy and pathological hemispheres. All metrics showed significant differences between healthy and pathologic hemispheres over the entire tract and between peritumoral segments. Peritumoral values were lower for FA and FD, but higher for ADC within the entire cohort. FD was more specific to tumor-induced changes in CST than ADC or FA, whereas ADC and FA showed higher sensitivity. The bihemispheric along-tract analysis provides an approach to detect subject-specific structural changes in healthy and pathological WM. In the current clinical dataset, the more complex FD metrics did not outperform FA and ADC in terms of describing corticospinal tract impairment.},

Although tracking algorithms have improved during the last two decades, results of validation studies and international challenges warn about the reliability of tractography and point out the need for improved algorithms. In propagationbased tracking, connections have traditionally been modeled as piece-wise linear segments. In this work, we propose a novel propagation-based tracker that is capable of generating geometrically smooth (C1) curves using parallel transport frames. Notably, our approach does not increase the complexity of the propagation problem that remains two-dimensional. Moreover, our tracker has a novel mechanism to reduce noise related propagation errors by incorporating topographic regularity of connections, a neuroanatomic property of many brain pathways. We ran extensive experiments and compared our approach against deterministic and other probabilistic algorithms. Our experiments on FiberCup and ISMRM 2015 challenge datasets as well as on 56 subjects of the Human Connectome Project show highly promising results both visually and quantitatively. Open-source implementations of the algorithm are shared publicly.publicly.},

	abstract = {Background Fiber tracking with diffusion-weighted MRI has become an essential tool for estimating in vivo brain white matter architecture. Fiber tracking results are sensitive to the choice of processing method and tracking criteria. Purpose To assess the variability for an algorithm in group studies reproducibility is of critical context. However, reproducibility does not assess the validity of the brain connections. Phantom studies provide concrete quantitative comparisons of methods relative to absolute ground truths, yet do no capture variabilities because of in vivo physiological factors. The ISMRM 2017 TraCED challenge was created to fulfill the gap. Study Type A systematic review of algorithms and tract reproducibility studies. Subjects Single healthy volunteers. Field Strength/Sequence 3.0T, two different scanners by the same manufacturer. The multishell acquisition included b-values of 1000, 2000, and 3000 s/mm2 with 20, 45, and 64 diffusion gradient directions per shell, respectively. Assessment Nine international groups submitted 46 tractography algorithm entries each consisting 16 tracts per scan. The algorithms were assessed using intraclass correlation (ICC) and the Dice similarity measure. Statistical Tests Containment analysis was performed to assess if the submitted algorithms had containment within tracts of larger volume submissions. This also serves the purpose to detect if spurious submissions had been made. Results The top five submissions had high ICC and Dice {\textgreater}0.88. Reproducibility was high within the top five submissions when assessed across sessions or across scanners: 0.87–0.97. Containment analysis shows that the top five submissions are contained within larger volume submissions. From the total of 16 tracts as an outcome relatively the number of tracts with high, moderate, and low reproducibility were 8, 4, and 4. Data Conclusion The different methods clearly result in fundamentally different tract structures at the more conservative specificity choices. Data and challenge infrastructure remain available for continued analysis and provide a platform for comparison. Level of Evidence: 5 Technical Efficacy Stage: 1 J. Magn. Reson.

	abstract = {Diffusion MRI fiber tractography is widely used to probe the structural connectivity of the brain, with a range of applications in both clinical and basic neuroscience. Despite widespread use, tractography has well-known pitfalls that limits the anatomical accuracy of this technique. Numerous modern methods have been developed to address these shortcomings through advances in acquisition, modeling, and computation. To test whether these advances improve tractography accuracy, we organized the 3-D Validation of Tractography with Experimental MRI (3D-VoTEM) challenge at the ISBI 2018 conference. We made available three unique independent tractography validation datasets – a physical phantom and two ex vivo brain specimens - resulting in 176 distinct submissions from 9 research groups. By comparing results over a wide range of fiber complexities and algorithmic strategies, this challenge provides a more comprehensive assessment of tractography's inherent limitations than has been reported previously. The central results were consistent across all sub-challenges in that, despite advances in tractography methods, the anatomical accuracy of tractography has not dramatically improved in recent years. Taken together, our results independently confirm findings from decades of tractography validation studies, demonstrate inherent limitations in reconstructing white matter pathways using diffusion MRI data alone, and highlight the need for alternative or combinatorial strategies to accurately map the fiber pathways of the brain.},

	abstract = {Topographic regularity is an important biological principle in brain connections that has been observed in various anatomical studies. However, there has been limited research on mathematically characterizing this property and applying it in the analysis of in vivo connectome imaging data. In this work, we propose a general mathematical model of topographic regularity for white matter fiber bundles based on previous neuroanatomical understanding. Our model is based on a novel group spectral graph analysis (GSGA) framework motivated by spectral graph theory and tensor decomposition. The GSGA provides a common set of eigenvectors for the graphs formed by topographic proximity of nearby tracts, which gives rises to the group graph spectral distance, or G2SD, for measuring the topographic regularity of each fiber tract in a tractogram. Based on this novel model of topographic regularity in fiber tracts, we then develop a tract filtering algorithm that can generally be applied to remove outliers in tractograms generated by any tractography algorithm. In the experimental results, we show that our novel algorithm outperforms existing methods in both simulation data from ISMRM 2015 Tractography Challenge and real data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). On a large-scale dataset from 215 HCP subjects, we quantitatively show our method can significantly improve the retinotopy in the reconstruction of the optic radiation bundle. The software for the tract filtering algorithm developed in this work has also been publicly released on NITRC (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/connectopytool).},

In particular the retinotopic mapping of the visual pathway can even be quantitatively computed. Inspired from this previously untapped anatomical knowledge, we propose a novel tractography method that preserves both topographic and geometric regularity. We make use of parameterized curves with Frenet-Serret frame and introduce a highly flexible mechanism for controlling geometric regularity. At the same time, we incorporate a novel local data support term in order to account for topographic organization. Unifying geometry with topographic regularity, we develop a Bayesian framework for generating highly organized streamlines that accurately follow neuroanatomy. We additionally propose two novel validation techniques to quantify topographic regularity. In our experiments, we studied the results of our approach with respect to connectivity, reproducibility and topographic regularity aspects. We present both qualitative and quantitative comparisons of our technique against three algorithms from MRtrix3. We show that our method successfully generates highly organized fiber tracks while capturing bundle anatomy that are geometrically challenging for other approaches.},

	abstract = {Tractography is a powerful technique capable of non-invasively reconstructing the structural connections in the brain using diffusion MRI images, but the validation of tractograms is challenging due to lack of ground truth. Owing to recent developments in mapping the mouse brain connectome, high-resolution tracer injection-based axonal projection maps have been created and quickly adopted for the validation of tractography. Previous studies using tracer injections mainly focused on investigating the match in projections and optimal tractography protocols. Being a complicated technique, however, tractography relies on multiple stages of operations and parameters. These factors introduce large variabilities in tractograms, hindering the optimization of protocols and making the interpretation of results difficult. Based on this observation, in contrast to previous studies, in this work we focused on quantifying and ranking the amount of performance variation introduced by these factors. For this purpose, we performed over a million tractography experiments and studied the variability across different subjects, injections, anatomical constraints and tractography parameters. By using N-way ANOVA analysis, we show that all tractography parameters are significant and importantly performance variations with respect to the differences in subjects are comparable to the variations due to tractography parameters, which strongly underlines the importance of fully documenting the tractography protocols in scientific experiments. We also quantitatively show that inclusion of anatomical constraints is the most significant factor for improving tractography performance. Although this critical factor helps reduce false positives, our analysis indicates that anatomy-informed tractography still fails to capture a large portion of axonal projections.},

Previous techniques were mainly based on computing pair-wise distances and clustering methods to identify unwanted tracks, which relied heavy upon user inputs for parameter tuning. In this work, we propose the use of topological information in track density images (TDI) to achieve a more robust filtering of tracks. There are two main steps of our iterative algorithm. Given a fiber bundle, we first convert it to a TDI, then extract and score its critical points. After that, tracks that contribute to high scoring loops are identified and removed using the Reeb graph of the level set surface of the TDI. Our approach is geometrically intuitive and relies only on a single parameter that enables the user to decide on the length of insignificant loops. In our experiments, we use our method to reconstruct the optic radiation in human brain using the multi-shell HARDI data from the human connectome project (HCP). We compare our results against spectral filtering and show that our approach can achieve cleaner reconstructions. We also apply our method to 215 HCP subjects to test for asymmetry of the optic radiation and obtain statistically significant results that are consistent with post-mortem studies.},

However, there are currently only a limited number of hydrogels applicable for 2PP-DLW. In order to widen the selection of synthetic biodegradable hydrogels, in this work we studied the 2PP-DLW of methacryloylated and acryloylated poly(α-amino acid)s (poly(AA)s). The performance of these materials was compared to widely used poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylates (PEGdas) in terms of polymerization and damage thresholds, voxel size, line width, post-polymerization swelling and deformation. We found that both methacryloylated and acryloylated poly(AA) hydrogels are suitable to 2PP-DLW with a wider processing window than PEGdas. The poly(AA) with the highest degree of acryloylation showed the greatest potential for 3D microfabrication.},

In this study, we use our recently introduced connectivity measure, called the contour tree connectivity (CTC), to study microstructures for flow analysis. CTC is a new structural connectivity measure that is based on contour trees and algebraic graph theory. To test CTC, we generated a dataset composed of 120 samples and six different types of artificial microstructures. We compared CTC against the Euler parameter (EP), the parameter for connected pairs, the nominal opening dimension (dnom) and the permeabilities estimated using direct pore scale modelling. The results show that dnom is highly correlated with permeability (R2 = 0.91), but cannot separate the structural differences. The groups are best classified with feature combinations that include CTC. CTC provides new information with a different connectivity interpretation that can be used to analyse and design materials with complex microstructures.},

	abstract = {The connectivity of microstructures is directly related to the physical properties of materials. Currently, the Euler number is the most popular measure of connectivity. It is an elegant topological invariant, however, it does not provide information about cavities or the proximities and sizes of objects. In this thesis, an alternative measure called contour tree connectivity (CTC) is developed and its applications for the analysis of microstructures are studied. CTC is derived from contour trees that are used in the first publication to represent complex binary images with simple graphs. By analyzing contour trees, CTC produces new connectivity information that is not provided by other approaches described in the literature. Contour tree representation of binary images and CTC can be computed for any dimensions of data and topology as explained in the second publication. Moreover, CTC is designed to be a scalar between 0 and 1, which makes it easy to use and understand.

In this thesis, the use of CTC for analyzing microstructures is presented in two studies. In the first study, the microstructure of trabecular bone is analyzed in relation to its mechanical strength. In the second study, the relationship between microstructures and the fluid flow within materials are examined. The results from these studies show that CTC contributes to the understanding of how the structural properties of materials are linked to their physical properties.

To conclude, with its unique properties, CTC complements the structural information provided by currently used measures. This makes it an important image analysis tool for the study of the microstructures of materials such as soil, paper, filters and food products as well as biomaterials and biological tissues.},

The cell medium (fluid) transports the cells into the microscaffold and is an effective factor for cell growth and stimulation. The architecture of microscaffolds influences fluid flow characteristics such as velocity and shear stress during cell seeding. Shear stress is known to stimulate the cells in scaffolds. Therefore, it is interesting for biomaterial researchers and scaffold designers, to understand how the shape and porosity of the microscaffold influences the dynamics of fluid flows. In this work, we modeled the flow in three-dimensional rectangular, cylindrical, and spherical micropore networks with various porosities. The velocity distribution and mean wall shear stress are computed and compared for a single-phase flow. It is noted that grid independency is achieved when any further increase in the number of cells did not adversely affect the simulation results. Results show that spherical micropores with porosity higher than 80\% are suitable for those types of cells that must be stimulated with low shear stress. In contrast, rectangular and cylindrical micropore networks can be used for cells that should be stimulated with high shear stress.},

	abstract = {Traditional scaffold fabrication methods used in tissue engineering enable only limited control over essential parameters such as porosity, pore size and pore interconnectivity. In this study, we designed and fabricated five different types of three-dimensionally interconnected, highly porous scaffolds with precise control over the scaffold characteristics. We used two-photon polymerization (2PP) with a commercial polymer–ceramic material (Ormocomp®) for scaffold fabrication. Also for the first time, we analyzed the 2PP fabrication accuracy with respect to scaffold design parameters. Our results showed that the porosity values decreased up to 13\% compared to the design specifications due to the fabrication process and the shrinkage of the material. Finally, we showed that our scaffolds supported human adipose stem cell adhesion and proliferation in a six day culture. By precise tuning of scaffold parameters, our design and fabrication method provides a novel approach for studying the effect of scaffold architecture on cell behavior in vitro.},

	abstract = {There is a growing need in medical image processing to analyze segmented objects. In this study we are interested in analyzing morphological properties of complex structures such as the trabecular bone. Although, there are various shape description approaches proposed in the literature, there is not an adequate method to represent foreground object(s) morphology with respect to the background. In this article, we propose a way of representing binary images of any dimensions using graphs that emphasize connectivity of level-sets to foreground and background. We start by calculating the euclidean distance transform (EDT) to create a scalar field. Then the contour tree of this scalar field is calculated using a modified version of the algorithm proposed by Carr. Contour trees are mostly used to visualize high dimensional scalar fields as they can put on view the critical points, i.e: local min, max and saddle points; however, their use in representing complex shapes have not been studied. We demonstrate the use of our method on artificial 2D images having different topologies as well as 3D \&mu;-CT images of two bone biopsies. We show that the application of contour trees to complex binary data particularly prove useful when interpreting pore-networks at micro-scale. Further work to quantify foreground and background interconnectivity using certain graph theoretical methods is still under research.},

	abstract = {A micro-computed tomography (μ-CT) image analysis was used in the micro-structural analysis of self-reinforced bioabsorbable osteoconductive composites. The composites studied were known to have a porous structure, but the total porosity of these composites had not been measured due to lack of interconnected pores. The micro-structure of the composites studied has previously been estimated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). This yielded a very rough estimation of the micro-structure based only on the surface estimate and thus more precise μ-CT image analyses of the total porosity and volumetric filler distribution were done. The present study was performed on five different composites manufactured with either single-screw or twin-screw extruder. All the samples had the same bioabsorbable matrix polymer, poly-l/dl-lactide 70/30. The filler material was either bioactive glass (BaG) 13–93 or β-tri calcium phosphate (β-TCP). The results illustrate the possibility of μ-CT image analysis for analyzing the micro-structures of the self-reinforced bioabsorbable osteoconductive composites. Especially the three-dimensional volumetric analysis of the filler particle distribution inside the composite showed results not received before.},
