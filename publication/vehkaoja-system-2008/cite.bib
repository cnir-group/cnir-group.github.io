 abstract = {We present a system for measuring ECG signals simultaneously from multiple persons during a group training session. The system transmits the signals to a coordinating computer where heart rate and other parameters are calculated from the signals. The heart rate values can then be shown for example through a video projector on a large display along with individual information about the training intensity.},
