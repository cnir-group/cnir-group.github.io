 abstract = {Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that is widely used in both research and clinical settings. However, state-of-the-art TMS guidance systems do not leverage the valuable structural connectivity in real-time applications. This is mainly due to the limitations of tractography which has been increasingly pointed out in validation studies. In order to address this problem, in this work we propose a novel visualization approach that is capable of providing information about the uncertainty of obtained streamlines. Our technique offers an easy and intuitive way for the TMS operator to interpret the displayed streamlines in real-time.},
