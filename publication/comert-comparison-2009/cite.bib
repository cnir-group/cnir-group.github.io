 abstract = {As preventive healthcare for cardiac patients and risk groups as well as EKG in sports and daily life monitoring are developing, the need to have a monitoring system unencumbered by cables is growing. The usage of conventional electrodes is made unsuitable by the cabling, as this causes artifacts and lowers the user friendliness of the system. The nature of the medical electrodes makes them not suitable for use in general populations where the patient needs an easy way to attach the electrodes.},
