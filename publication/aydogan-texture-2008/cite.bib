 abstract = {In this study, four different dual-tree complex wavelet (DT-CWT) based texture feature extraction methods are developed and compared to segment and classify tissues. Methods that are proposed in this study are based on local energy calculations of sub-bands. Two of the methods use rotation variant texture features and the other two use rotation invariant features. The methods are tested on two texture compositions from the Brodatz texture database and two actual magnetic resonance (MR) images. Results show that there is not a significant difference between using rotation variant or invariant features. On the other hand, for the same Brodatz textures, all DT-CWT based feature extraction methods are competitive with other filtering approaches.},
