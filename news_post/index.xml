&lt;p>This initiative perfectly complements our ongoing efforts in the Research Council of Finland-funded GUIDE-IN-TMS project. By integrating advanced AI-based diagnostic tools, the new project will enable us to significantly enhance our approach to personalized brain stimulation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are deeply grateful to the foundation for the generous â‚¬300,000 funding. Over the next three years, this support will allow us to advance the technology to a clinical trial-ready stage, bringing us closer to transforming depression treatment.&lt;/p>

There will be two presentations from our group.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Joonas has a poster presentation about his work related to closed-loop TMS-EEG experiments inside MRI. We have been conducting a lot of experiment during the last year to check the feasibility and robustness of EEG-phase estimation during concurrent fMRI measurements. Joonas has been very busy with the analysis of the collected data. Finally, all is ready, and he will present these results in the conference.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other presentation will be in a fast-track symposium titled: &amp;ldquo;The potential of microstructural brain imaging in the field of non-invasive brain stimulation&amp;rdquo;. There I will present our work on targeting networks of the brain with real-time tractography-based TMS neuronavigation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Find us at the conference! Let&amp;rsquo;s chat.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>We are kicking off CNIR group's website!</title><link>https://cnir-group.github.io/news_post/23-01-02-cnir-website-kickoff/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cnir-group.github.io/news_post/23-01-02-cnir-website-kickoff/</guid><description>&lt;!--Welcome to Computational NeuroImaging Research (CNIR) group!

&lt;!--We are a team of dedicated engineers who are passionate about advancing the understanding of the brain and help treat its disorders. We aim to develop new methods and tools for neuroscience and clinical research. Our research focuses on using advanced imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to study the structure and function of the brain and its connections, or tracts.
We believe that by studying the brain in detail, we can gain insights into a wide range of neurological and psychiatric conditions, and ultimately improve patient care. Our research is at the forefront of the field, and we are always striving to push the boundaries of what is possible.-->
&lt;p>We are excited to share our research with you, and we invite you to explore our website to learn more about what we do. Thank you for visiting!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
