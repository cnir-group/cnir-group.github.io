There will be two presentations from our group.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Joonas has a poster presentation about his work related to closed-loop TMS-EEG experiments inside MRI. We have been conducting a lot of experiment during the last year to check the feasibility and robustness of EEG-phase estimation during concurrent fMRI measurements. Joonas has been very busy with the analysis of the collected data. Finally, all is ready, and he will present these results in the conference.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other presentation will be in a fast-track symposium titled: &amp;ldquo;The potential of microstructural brain imaging in the field of non-invasive brain stimulation&amp;rdquo;. There I will present our work on targeting networks of the brain with real-time tractography-based TMS neuronavigation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Find us at the conference! Let&amp;rsquo;s chat.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>We are kicking off the CNIR group's website!</title><link>https://cnir-group.github.io/news_post/23-01-02-cnir-website-kickoff/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cnir-group.github.io/news_post/23-01-02-cnir-website-kickoff/</guid><description>&lt;!--Welcome to Computational NeuroImaging Research (CNIR) group!

&lt;!--We are a team of dedicated engineers who are passionate about advancing the understanding of the brain and help treat its disorders. We aim to develop new methods and tools for neuroscience and clinical research. Our research focuses on using advanced imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to study the structure and function of the brain and its connections, or tracts.
We believe that by studying the brain in detail, we can gain insights into a wide range of neurological and psychiatric conditions, and ultimately improve patient care. Our research is at the forefront of the field, and we are always striving to push the boundaries of what is possible.-->
&lt;p>We are excited to share our research with you, and we invite you to explore our website to learn more about what we do. Thank you for visiting, and we hope you will continue to follow our work as we strive to make meaningful contributions to the field.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
